//    Create a class for your favorite type of animal. The class should be named for your animal - Cat, Dog, Parrot etc. It should have two instance variables - name and sound - and one method - makeNoise(). The output of the makeNoise method should be name +  " goes " + sound. Create a test class with a main method to instantiate and test your class code.
