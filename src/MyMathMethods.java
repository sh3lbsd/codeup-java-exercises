//Create a class called MyMathMethods
//        Create a method in there called multiply
//Have it take two integer parameters and return the product of the two integers
//Do not create a main method in your MyMathMethods class
//Instead, create a test class, and run your multiply method from a main method in your test class
//If you want a bonus, you can overload the method with a version that takes doubles instead of ints as its parameters
//As another bonus … after you’re done, refactor so the multiply method is static, then refactor your test so as to use the static method
// another bonus: getInput from the user
public class MyMathMethods {

    public static int multiply(int num1, int num2){
        return num1 * num2;
