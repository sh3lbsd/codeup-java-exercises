////================================= ABSTRACT CLASS MINI-EXERCISE
////        -- PART 1
////        Consider a library. In the library, there are various forms of media accessible to the public. A patron of a library can access
////        newspapers, books, microfiche, magazines, records, cds, etc.
////        Create a Media abstract class
////Identify at least one process that can be done the same way for each form of media. Add a public void instance method named after this thing and give it a message to print simply print out generally describing this process.
//abstract class Media {
//    public String gatherResearch() {
//        System.out.println("collecting data");
//    }
//}
////          Identify at least one process that be done for each form of media but requires a unique approach / implementation for each specific
////          sub-type of media. Create an abstract method that defines method signature for this process but does not include the method body.
////        Extend from Media with one of the above listed sub-types of media
////        Include an implementation (method body) of the abstract method created in the Media class
////BONUS: identify and add another abstract method to the Media class and extend the Media class in additional sub-types (edited)
