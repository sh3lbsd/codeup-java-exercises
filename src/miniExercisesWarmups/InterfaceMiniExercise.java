//================================= INTERFACE MINI EXERCISE
//        Consider the following classes and methods:
//        Car
//        on()
//        off()
//        moveForward(int distanceInMeters)
//        getCurrentLatLng()
//        demolish()
//        Plane
//        on()
//        off()
//        getCurrentLatLng()
//        demolish()
//        Bicycle
//        getCurrentLatLng()
//        demolish()
//        What methods make the most sense to include in a PowerControllable interface?
//        What methods make the most sense to include in an abstract Vehicle class?
//        What class(s) should implement the PowerControllable interface?
//        What methods in the abstract class should be abstract? What methods are general to all sub-types?
//        --------------------- PART 2
//        Consider the library scenerio from the previous mini-exercise.
//        Also consider the following abstract class, Person.
//        Person could be extended in these sub-types:
//        Librarian
//        Archivist
//        Patron
//        Researcher
//        etc.
//        Between Media and Person, what are some common interfaces that may exist? In other words, what are some things that can be done with
//        or done to both Media and Person? Yet another way of considering the relationship between these two ideas: in what ways can you interact with
//        both a Person and form of Media in a library the same way?
//        For each shared aspect/way to interface with/interact with these two things, create an interface. Define methods (no implementation) that one could exepect
//        to do when interfacing with both a Person and a form of Media.
//        BONUS: consider the abstract class LibraryFurniture. What additional interfaces or previously created interfaces may be implemented by a LibraryFurniture class?
